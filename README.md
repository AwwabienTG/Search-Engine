# Search-Engine
Search engine algorithm uses keywords to score a search input with a results vector

The search engine is able to ignore punctuation and is able to match singular words with their plural form and vice versa

Common words (given 0 weighting in search) can be modified

The results can also be modified (must stay as a list)

Automatic sorting of results based on weighting

Increased compatbility bu using lists as output instead of dictionaries

Friendly design and output

Algorithm complexity of O(n^3n)
